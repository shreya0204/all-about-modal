# All About Modal 🎯

![Image](/assets/banner-1544x500.png)

A modern, lightweight modal & popup plugin for WordPress. Built with marketers in mind, and engineered for flexibility. Show anything, anywhere, anytime without writing a single line of code. Whether you're capturing leads, announcing offers, or nudging users, this is your go-to modal buddy.


## 🚀 Features

### **Smart triggers**

  Show modals on scroll, exit-intent, page load, click, hover, focus, or even when the element scrolls into view.
### **Wrap any element to trigger a modal**

  Want a button, image, or even a heading to trigger a modal? Just wrap it inside the **All About Modal** block and that block becomes the trigger.
### **Editor-first experience**

  Works natively with the WordPress block editor. Easily add modals as blocks and configure their behavior through block settings.
### **Zero JS required**

  Powered by the open-source `tp-modal` web component from [Travelopia](https://github.com/Travelopia) and yes, thank you, Travelopia! 🙌
### **Mobile-friendly and responsive**

  Choose to show your modal on desktop, mobile, or both.
### **Reusable across pages**

  Create once, use anywhere. Modals are stored as a custom post type, making content management seamless.

If you're serious about conversion, modals are one of the most high-ROI tools in your toolbox, when used right.



## 🔧 How It Works

1. Go to **Modals > Add New**, and create your modal content.
2. Add the **All About Modal** block anywhere in your content ( or wrap any block inside it).
3. Choose the modal to show and configure how it should trigger.
4. Save and publish. You’re live.

Yes, it’s really that simple.
